disappointed with the lack of support.I’ve been trying to reach customer service for days and no one answers,I need urgent assistance.I received the wrong information from the support team,I expect better and more accurate service.Customer service promised a callback that never came,I was left hanging with no response.My issue was not escalated to the right department,I’m now even more frustrated with the situation.I was told one thing by customer service and then the opposite by another representative,It’s confusing and time-wasting.I’ve emailed customer service multiple times and haven’t received a response,This is poor communication.The representative was rude and didn’t help with my problem,This kind of service is unacceptable.I was transferred to multiple agents without any resolution,I’m getting frustrated with the lack of efficiency.I was told my problem was fixed, but it’s still unresolved,This is very disappointing.Customer service didn’t follow up after our initial conversation,I was left in the dark about the next steps.The agent didn’t listen to my issue properly,I had to explain myself multiple times.I was put on hold for over 45 minutes and never got an update,This is a terrible experience.The representative didn’t offer any solutions to my issue,I expect a more proactive approach.My inquiry was completely ignored by the customer service team,I need help and it’s not being provided.I had to repeat my issue to every new agent I spoke to,This process should be more streamlined.Customer service was dismissive of my concerns,I felt completely unheard.I was told I’d get a refund but it’s been weeks and nothing has been processed,This is very frustrating.After speaking with customer service, my issue only got worse,This is not how it should be handled.The agent was unable to provide any useful information,I expected a much better level of knowledge.I received conflicting information from different customer service representatives,It’s

for my concerns.I was given a time frame for a resolution, but it passed without any follow-up,This is frustrating and unprofessional.The representative was not knowledgeable about the product,I needed a more experienced person to help me.My issue wasn’t properly documented, so I had to explain it again and again,This is not efficient.I was told my problem would be resolved in 24 hours, but it’s been a week,This lack of follow-through is unacceptable.I’ve been left waiting for a call back that never came,It’s very disappointing.I tried using the live chat support, but the agent was slow to respond,I expected quicker service.The representative didn’t show any empathy or understanding for my issue,This was a very cold interaction.I was promised a resolution within a certain time frame but heard nothing after,This is very frustrating.Customer service provided no alternative solutions,I felt completely stuck.I asked to speak to a manager, but no one was available,This is very unprofessional.I’ve been given wrong instructions by the customer service team,This has caused further delays.The agent didn’t offer an apology for the inconvenience caused,It was a lack of basic customer care.The customer service team didn’t acknowledge my loyalty as a customer,I expected more respect and attention.Every time I contact customer service, I get a different story,This inconsistency is making things worse.I was given false information about a promotion,This is unacceptable and misleading.I was waiting for an email confirmation that never came,Now I’m left wondering what happened.I was promised a follow-up but have heard nothing,I feel ignored.I had to repeatedly explain the issue to customer service,It’s like my concerns weren’t taken seriously.The customer service process was complicated and took way too long,I expect a more straightforward approach.I was given a tracking number, but it doesn’t show any updates,This is frustrating.I wasn’t informed of a policy change, which caused confusion,Customer service should have notified me.After waiting for so long, customer service couldn’t even resolve my issue,This is a terrible experience.I was transferred to the wrong department twice,I lost valuable time.Customer service gave me no update on the status of my request,I’m left with no answers.The representative I spoke to didn’t seem to care about my issue,This made me feel unimportant.I had to follow up multiple times to get any action on my issue,This should have been addressed sooner.The agent didn’t take ownership of my problem,I was passed around between different people.My issue wasn’t resolved, and I’m still waiting for a solution,I need immediate attention.I felt like the customer service team was avoiding my calls,This is very frustrating.I received no communication after submitting my complaint,This is very unprofessional.I had to call multiple times to get the same information,This process should be much quicker.Customer service ignored my request for escalation,I needed my issue to be prioritized.Every time I reach out, I’m told a different story,This is causing confusion and stress.I was told the issue was being looked into, but no one ever followed up,This is unacceptable.The representative I spoke to was not friendly or helpful,I felt completely ignored.I requested a refund, but no one has

answer.Customer service was unprofessional and unresponsive,I’m very disappointed with the support I received.I requested a return but was told I’m ineligible for one,This is a confusing policy.Every time I contact support, I have to repeat my issue,This is extremely inconvenient.I was promised a callback that never came,I’m still waiting for someone to reach out.I was told I’d get a resolution within 24 hours, but it’s been days,This is completely unacceptable.I’ve been trying to resolve my issue for weeks with no progress,I feel completely ignored.Customer service didn’t provide any clear instructions on how to resolve my issue,This lack of clarity is frustrating.I was told my case was being escalated, but I haven’t heard anything since,I need an update.The customer service rep I spoke to was unprofessional and rude,I expect better treatment.My request was closed without any resolution or explanation,This is not how issues should be handled.I was not given an apology for the inconvenience caused,Basic courtesy was missing from the interaction.I was told I’d get an update in 48 hours, but it’s been much longer,This delay is unacceptable.I’ve had multiple interactions with customer service and nothing has been resolved,This has been a waste of my time.Customer service promised me a resolution that was never delivered,I feel misled and frustrated.The representative I spoke to didn’t have the proper knowledge to help me,This made the issue worse.I was told my issue would be fixed immediately, but it wasn’t,I’m still waiting for resolution.Customer service didn’t follow up with me as promised,This is very disappointing.I was given an incomplete solution to my problem,This left me even more confused.Customer service was unable to process my request
